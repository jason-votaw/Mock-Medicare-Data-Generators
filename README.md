# CMS Medicare Mock Data Generator and Parser

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio effort to demonstrate my ability to work with complex Medicare data formats used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). It includes Python scripts that generate and parse mock versions of key CMS files, specifically the **Medicare Advantage Monthly Membership Report (MMR)** and the **Medicare Advantage Organization Report (MOR)**.

All data is entirely **synthetic** and was created for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. No real patient or provider data is used.

## Project Goals

- Emulate the structure and logic of CMS fixed-width text files (MMR and MOR).
- Convert fixed-width data into structured `.csv` files for easier analysis.
- Provide a realistic demonstration of healthcare data engineering skills.
- Showcase the ability to automate parsing, QA, and transformation of CMS data formats.
